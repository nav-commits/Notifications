Your users can:

- Distinguish between **unread** and **read** notifications
- Select **"Mark all as read"** to toggle all notifications to read and set the unread count to zero
- View an **optimal layout** depending on their device's screen size
- See **hover** and **focus** states for all interactive elements

## Getting Started
